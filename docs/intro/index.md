# Category Theory for Programming

`Categoy Theory` is a tool for writing and executing code in multiple programming languages in a single document. It is based on the idea of a category, which is a mathematical structure that consists of objects and morphisms. In the context of programming languages, objects are types and morphisms are functions. 

**`Categoy Theory`** allows you to define objects and morphisms in different programming languages and compose them together to create new functions.
