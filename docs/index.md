# Welcome to `Category Theory through Math and Programming for Dummies`


## Project 

The aim of the  project is to provide an introdcution to category theory concepts, their connections to other areas of mathematics and applications in programming. 

The current "book" in no way is a comprehensive guide to category theory or its applications. We want to emphasize that the author is not an expert in either category theory or functional programming. The book is an attepmt to learn and understand the concepts of category theory and its applications in programming and provide a resource for others who are interested in the same to leanr and contribute to the project.
